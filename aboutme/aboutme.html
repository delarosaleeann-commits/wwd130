    <p style="text-align: center;">Hey everyone, I’m Lee Ann Staley, nice to meet you all! I’m a Second-generation Filipina, SoCal native from Lancaster, CA. 
        I have six siblings and love them each dearly. Recently, I was married to my dear husband and we are currently living in Idaho Falls, Idaho! 
        I am studying Cyber Security. I love music (guitar, piano, violin, singing, songwriting etc.), art (drawing, painting, crafts, fashion), 
        photography/videography/editing, sports (volleyball, pickleball, tennis, dancing, hiking, running), cooking, traveling, dad jokes, learning, 
        and trying new things. </p>
